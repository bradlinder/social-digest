Automated digest builder for Bluesky and Mastodon with tabbed admin workflows, interactive next-run workbench, dry-run preview, media optimization (WebP/AVIF), and local asset caching.

== Description ==
Social Digest is a WordPress plugin that automates the aggregation and publication of your decentralized social updates from Bluesky (AT Protocol) and Mastodon (ActivityPub) into publication-ready WordPress digest articles.

== Changelog ==

= 5.4 =
* Persist Cutoff Timestamps strictly on publication success, preventing unpublished workbench candidate fetches from silently advancing cutoffs.
* Fixed admin nonce action verification mismatches for manual automated imports and cutoff marker resets.
* Added Active Schedule Warning banner in the Workbench when automated cron is scheduled and unpublished candidate drafts exist.
* Added "Disabled (Manual Workbench Curation Only)" schedule option under General Settings to prevent background cron overwrites.
* Added protective JavaScript confirmation dialog to "Fetch / Refresh Next Run" when staged candidates exist.
* Harmonized network_mode fallback default to 'both' across settings registration and UI selects.
* Removed obsolete transient cleanup dead code from workbench reset routine.

= 5.3.5_beta =
* Restored and enhanced title template settings with hashtag enclosure and delimiter customization options and variable guide.
* Improved frontend live preview simulation fidelity and synchronicity with WordPress 6.7+.

= 5.3.4 =
* Upgraded to the Next-Run Editorial Workbench state-driven architecture, centralizing digest creation into a modular state machine.
* Unified settings page layout with responsive collapsible postboxes and optimized padding.
* Added live server-side simulation POST handlers for all publishing and curation actions.

= 5.3.3 =
* Implemented live WordPress server-side POST operational handlers for all publishing actions ("Publish Staged Digest Now", "Save Staging Draft", and "Send to Pending Review") on the Actions page, supporting temporary override settings and direct publication.

= 5.3.2 =
* Resolved tab redirection issue by making "General Settings" the default primary tab and placing it before "Actions, Staging & Diagnostics" in admin navigation.
* Unified all staging queue features, split/stacked view toggles, publishing actions ("Publish Staged Digest Now", "Save Staging Draft", "Send to Pending Review", "Clear Queue"), live preview, and header/footer editor directly within the Actions, Staging & Diagnostics tab.
* Adjusted widget header icon layout and padding across all admin postboxes, moving header graphics (clock, image, gear, performance, etc.) closer to the left edge next to drag handles.

= 5.3.0 =
* Integrated interactive Next-Run Editorial Workbench directly into the main plugin core.
* Added Lead Story Pinning option to set an article to top priority for the next publish run.
* Converted all widgets on both Settings and Actions & Preview tabs into standard collapsible, movable postboxes.
* Fully compatible with WordPress 6.7+ and PHP 8.3+.
